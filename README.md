# Diablo
rocket league bot created using rlbot framework and Python

if you're interesting in rlbot and running this bot, you can find more information here: https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/wiki

This bot utilizes rlutilities_1_0_2 which can be painlessly installed locally by running the included setup.py file. The repo for that module can be found here: https://github.com/samuelpmish/RLUtilities/releases
rlutilities must either be local or installed properly via pip for this bot to function properly. Run the included setup.py to handle it for you.

Diablo is currently in it's final form. It's derpy and there's room for improvment everywhere but I'm done with him for the forseeable future. Heaven help any poor soul who attempts to learn anything from this mess.
